Project Proposal & Documentation

Project Title:

Autonomous AI Trading Agent Using Support & Resistance on XAUUSD (30M Timeframe)

Project Summary:

This project aims to build an autonomous AI trading agent that specializes in the support and resistance-based strategy. The agent will be trained using reinforcement learning and unsupervised techniques to detect key zones, execute trades, and learn from its mistakes in a closed feedback loop. The project will be limited to trading XAUUSD on the 30-minute timeframe, offering a focused environment for accuracy, repeatability, and consistency.

Technologies & Tools:

Core Technologies:

Python – Main development language.

MetaTrader 5 (MT5) – Trading platform (Python API used).

scikit-learn – For unsupervised clustering (support/resistance zone detection using DBSCAN).

Stable Baselines3 / RLlib – For reinforcement learning implementation.

Pandas, NumPy – Data processing.

Matplotlib/Plotly – Visualization.

VectorBT – For advanced backtesting.

PostgreSQL – Data storage.

Flask + React – Web dashboard for real-time monitoring.

TradingView WebSocket API – For real-time candlestick and volume data.

Scope:

In-Scope:

One asset: XAUUSD.

One timeframe: 30-minute.

Trading logic: Support and resistance + candlestick breakouts with volume confirmation.

Learning: Reinforcement learning with incremental and periodic retraining.

Monitoring: Web-based real-time dashboard.

Testing: Backtesting and demo trading on MT5.

Execution: Limit orders with slippage control, retry logic for failed orders.

Out-of-Scope (for now):

Multi-instrument trading.

Multi-timeframe analysis.

News-based sentiment analysis.

Core Features

1. Support & Resistance Zone Detection

Use DBSCAN clustering to group historical turning points.

Identify high-probability reversal or breakout zones.

Update dynamically based on the last 50 candles.

2. Reinforcement Learning Trading Agent

Observes the last 50 candles around S/R zones.

PPO (Proximal Policy Optimization) reinforcement learning model.

Actions: Buy, Sell, Hold, with configurable lot size (default: 0.02).

Reward function:

Profit/Loss from trade.

Penalty for hitting stop loss.

Bonus for achieving 1:3 risk/reward.

3. Trade Management

Entry only after candle closes above resistance or below support with confirmed volume breakout.

If volume is not confirmed, wait for confirmation candle.

Agent enters trade immediately once criteria are met.

Risk/Reward ratio: Fixed at 1:3.

Stop Loss and Take Profit calculated accordingly.

Use limit orders to control slippage.

Monitor spread via MT5 API.

Implement retry logic for failed orders.

Broker execution verification.

4. Learning from Mistakes

Failed trades logged and analyzed in PostgreSQL.

Incremental learning supported.

Retraining triggered:

After significant performance drops.

Periodically (e.g., weekly).

5. Real-Time Dashboard

Web-based dashboard built with Flask + React.

Final Thoughts

This project aims for a production-grade, self-improving trading AI, focused entirely on XAUUSD at the 30-minute timeframe. Combining reinforcement learning, smart clustering, volume confirmation, real-time monitoring, execution verification, and recovery logic makes this a robust and scalable system. It will start on a demo account, continually learn from its mistakes, and adapt its trading logic without human intervention.
